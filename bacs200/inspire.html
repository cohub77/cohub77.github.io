    <p class = "tab">Levy Rozman aka GothamChess is a chess youtuber and streamer who makes great content about chess. His content is sometimes very instructional helping his 
        viewers improve at the game and outplay their opponents, but he also makes a variety of fun chess videos that are very entertaining. He is the reason I started 
        to play chess recently and every time I watch him I am inspired to keep playing and trying to improve at chess. He also puts a lot of time into improving his own chess 
        on top of making content which is very admirable.
