                    <p>Web trends in technology have evolved tremendously over the past few years and have created an entire new landscape for technology and its future prospects. Websites have gone from being single page, very simple sites to becoming enormous multi-petabyte databases of information sourced from servers across the globe. Web Development trends have led to much more complex and resource intensive than ever before which has spurred technology and semiconductor companies to innovate and create more powerful hardware than ever before. </p>
                    <p>There has also been an enormous push towards artificial intelligence which has caused further innovation. Global change has happened due to this and Web Design is at the forefront of this new wave of artificial intelligence creating websites that were unimaginable just a few years ago and as technology continues to grow and become more advanced, websites have also been evolving right alongside them,  with sites like Google and YouTube having increasingly advanced search algorithms and tons of new features and easier access to information than ever before. This has also led to them collecting more information on users than ever allowing them to target ads and be more efficient with their advertising spending. Some websites' financial model is based solely on this user data collection since they can sell it to advertisers who want to target their ads to specific people and demographics, saving them money by only giving ads to people who are more likely to purchase their products and not wasting it on other people.
