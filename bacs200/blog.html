                    <p>In todays society, as the wealth gap between the ultra rich billionaires and the average American grows increasingly large. With people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos being worth hundreds of billions of dollars while there are people in the same country who will not even be able to afford their next meal. What can be done to curb this inequality and help distribute wealth more evenly across the country? And with the inevitable future of artificial intelligence and robots taking over many jobs, how can we ensure that all of that money does not just go to a few billionaires? </p>
                    <h2> Social Implications</h2>
                    <p> The social implications of wealth inequality are a highly debated topic and have many different views on if having a few very rich individuals is beneficial or not for everyone else. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Some people argue that these super rich individuals create jobs for many people using Amazon as an example and that it is good for the growth of society to have these people. It can help motivate entrepreneurs to take risks. On the other hand the simple fact that there are people in this country with more money that you could even spend in a lifetime
                        and also people who can barely afford to eat is a very real issue that needs to be addressed. Do they really need 100s of billions of dollars or could that money be better spent distributed to less wealthy individuals. This inequality also creates some animosity towards those wealthy people from lower income individuals who really need even a small fraction of what the wealthy have accrued. 
                    </p>
                    <h2> Economic Implications</h2>
                    <p>The economic implications of this issue are very complex and almost impossible to truly understand but throughout the years many accomplished economists have written their theories on how it affects the economy.</p>
                    <p>Some economists say that wealth inequality is a good thing since it incentivizes people to take risks and innovate hoping to become those wealthy few, and that limiting this potential would curb innovation and maybe cause some large corporations to move to different countries.</p>
                    <p>But, there is also research thats supports the opposing view with studies showing that increased wealth inequality can lead to lower income families spending less on education and skills which leads to less skilled workers being present and hurting the economy.</p>
                    <h2> Political Implications</h2>
                    <p> The political implications of this really depend on which view the government takes and how they decide to act on that. They could add higher taxes on these very wealthy corporations and distribute that money to help the lower and middle classes.</p>
                    <p>Or if they decide wealth inequality is good for the country they could lower taxes on corporations and rich individuals and try to promote more people to strive for that level of wealth. It all depends on who the citizens decide to elect into office and picking a candidate whose views align with the general population and has their best interests in mind.</p>
