                    <p>Economics and financial systems like online banking and investment platforms have changed drastically in the past few years and the web trends have had to adapt to this ever-changing economic landscape. With online banking becoming almost a necessity in today’s world, many banks and credit unions have had to develop websites and apps to attract customers and integrate these online systems with the already existing banking solutions. Individual investing has also seen a massive increase recently with online brokers making it easier than ever for everyday people to get a foot in the door and start investing rather than it mostly being huge multinational corporations and hedge funds doing the investing. Other investment opportunities like cryptocurrencies have also boomed in popularity with promises of decentralized and secure transactions making it a very appealing option to some. Web developers have had to create trading platforms for this new area of currency and make it easily accessible to as many people as possible. stry but with the quarantines and lockdowns that the COVID-19 pandemic caused, with schools being shut down and forced quickly into this online format of education. Web trends had to adapt quickly and some services like Zoom and Microsoft Teams exploded in popularity and many other online education resources have been created in their wake. Online education went from sort of a niche area to becoming something millions of students relied on daily to get their education since in person learning was not possible with the pandemic. Teachers also had to adapt to this new format of teaching and it shook up the whole landscape of education. Web development had to keep up with this new influx of demand for online education platforms and develop new tools that allowed teachers to convey information to their students in the best way possible.
